=head1 Description

You have two CSV files with mostly the same column names. But, the 'base' CSV files has gaps in its data, i.e. some cells are empty. Another CSV has data, but its too laborious to comb through it by hand. Use this CLI to fill in the gaps.

=head3 base

The CSV file into which you want to merge data.

=head3 merge

The CSV file with which you want to fill in data gaps in C<base>. 

=head3 columns

A quoted, anonymous list of column names. Non-ASCII column names are as yet untested.

=head3 search

The column name by which you want to match up rows in C<base> and C<merge>.

=head2 Optional Options

=head3 output

Name of a file to which you want to direct the refined data. Default is C<merged.csv>.

=head3 first-row-is-headers

Specify 1 or 0 (or do not specify at all) to designate the first row of both CSV files as column headings.

Default is 1, or TRUE (Remember, Perl has no built-in Boolean).
